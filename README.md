## ðŸ“– Introduction

Machine learning is a pivotal field in data science, enabling us to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. This repository aims to cover a wide range of machine learning models, from linear regression to advanced ensemble methods. You will find explanations, code samples, and practical advice to help you apply these models to real-world problems.

## ðŸ“š Models Covered

This repository covers a wide array of machine learning models, including but not limited to:

- **Linear Regression**: [Learn More](linear_regression.md)
- **Classification Models**: [Learn More](classification_models.md)
- **Clustering Models**: [Learn More](clustering_models.md)
- **Decision Trees**: [Learn More](decision_trees.md)
- **Random Forests**: [Learn More](random_forests.md)

Each model is explained in detail in dedicated Markdown files and accompanied by example code and usage guidelines.

## ðŸ“‚ Code Examples

You can find practical code examples and Jupyter notebooks in the respective folders for each model. Explore the code to understand how these models are implemented and utilized for different tasks.
